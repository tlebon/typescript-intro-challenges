  .add('to the TS intro challenge', () => <div><h1>Welcome!</h1>  <h2>So we have prepared a number of problems for you which we will go over one at a time!</h2>
  <p>The problems are within Storybook. Storybook is an awesome little wrapper for components to allow for a visual representation outside of your total project. </p>
  
  <p>For the purposes of this exercise we have elected to use it to create a series of isolated problems that you can run! If the component runs in storybook- <b>Good Job!</b> <br/>You solved the typescript problem and are one step closer to mastering types and hating your job a little more. :) </p>If you see an error, you still have some issue with your types inside of the component. 
  <h3>Uncomment the code within each problem's stories.tsx file to begin!</h3>
  </div>);
