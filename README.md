## Intro Typescript Challenges!


So we have prepared a number of problems for you which we will go over one at a time!
The problems are within Storybook. Storybook is an awesome little wrapper for components to allow for a visual representation outside of your total project. 
  
For the purposes of this exercise we have elected to use it to create a series of isolated problems that you can run! If the component runs in storybook- Good Job! You solved the typescript problem and are one step closer to mastering types and hating your job a little more. :) If you see an error, you still have some issue with your types inside of the component. 

Uncomment the code within each problem's stories.tsx file to begin!


## Getting Started

First thing is first!
We recommend using VScode and installing the typescript addon for some great informative error notifications!
Now- lets install all our dependencies! 
Go ahead and do that with either 

### `yarn` or `npm install`

You can use either, whichever you use will depend on which package manager you have. 
(it doesn't matter which you use).
The project is currently set up to use yarn (If you are using npm please delete the yarn.lock file before installation with npm)

## OK!

## How to Begin 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn storybook`

This will pull up the storybook package. Inside you can find the different problems inside each story. If the story works then you solved it.. if it doesnt, back to the drawing board.

## Good luck!

note: You _can_ find some possible solutions in the repo if you are really stuck.
